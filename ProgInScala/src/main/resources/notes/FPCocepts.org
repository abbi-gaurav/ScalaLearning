* Persistent data structures
We say that functional data structures are persistent, meaning that existing references are never changed by operations on the data structure
* Data sharing
* Folds
** foldRight must traverse all the way to the end of the list (pushing frames onto the call stack as we go) before it can begin collapsing it.
* ADT *algebraic data types*
** it is the sum or union of its data constructors
