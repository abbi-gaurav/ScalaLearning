#+OPTIONS: title:Programming In Scala Key Points

#+OPTIONS: toc:1 

* operands
** left or right operand (if a operator name ends with a ":", then it is a right operand)
*** a * b = a.*(b)
*** a :: b = b.::(a)
** when leave off "=" sign before the function body, the return type is always Unit, it is then a procedure for "side-effects"
* Companion objects
** defined with the same name as the class and in the same source file
** class and a companion object can access each others private members
* Formatting
** """ : better way to write strings which have lot of escape characters
* Symbol
** similar to undeclared identifier in a dynamically typed languge
* prefix and postfix
** unary operators: The only identifiers that can be used as prefix operators are +, -, !, and ~
** The convention is that you include parentheses if the method has side effects, such as println()
* Constructors
** The invoked constructor is either the primary constructor (as in the Rational example), or another auxiliary constructor that comes textually before the calling constructor.
* implicit
** The implicit modifier in front of the method tells the compiler to apply it automatically in a number of situations
** for an implicit conversion to work, it needs to be in scope. If you place the implicit method definition inside class Rational, it won’t be in scope in the interpreter.
* reassignment of vars results in *unit value*
** var x = 2
** x = 3 //this results in unit value
** so ((line = readLine()) != "") will always be true
* try-catch
** throw has a result type "Nothing"
** catch is based on pattern matching
* function literals and function values
** literals exists in source code
** values exists at runtime
* target typing : type inference
* placeholder "_"
** works only when parameter appears only once.
** e.g. List(1,2,3) filter (_ < 2)
* partially applied functions
** e.g.
*** println _
*** list foreach(println _)
*** list foreach(println) // in case all parameteres are partially applied
*** def sum (a:Int, b:Int)= a+b; val x = sum (1,_:Int); val p = sum _
*** def sum (a:Int) (b:Int) = a+b; val y = sum (2) _ ;
*** _ might not be required when the sum(2) is passed as a function parameter
**** def sum2(a:Int)(b:Int) = a+b; def x(f:Int=>Int) = f(2); x(sum2(3))
* closures
** (x:Int) => x+ 1 //closed term
** (x:Int) => x+more //open term since more is a free variable
** the function value created for an open term is achieved by binding its free variables, this is closure (it is an act of closing)
** closure sees the change to the free variable and also able to modify them
** in case there are several copies of the free variable, the one that was active at the  time closure is created is being used
* repeated parameters :
** def echo(args:String*)
** echo(); echo("hi"); echo ("hiii", "there"); val arr = Array("hiii"); echo(arr : _*)
* tail recursion
** complier optimizes the calls and uses only the single stack, iff the return value is the call to the function itself and nothing else
** can be turned off by using -g:notailcalls in scalac or repl
** currently limited to the case where the function calls itself directly, not through any intermediary. this is due to instruction set limitation of JVM
* fpConcepts.composition and inheritace
** fields and methods belong to same namespace
*** this implies that in subclass, one can override methods with field definitions
** scala has two namespaces
*** values (fields, methods, packages, and singleton objects)
*** types (class and trait names)
** parameteric field
*** class x(val param : Int){}
* scala class heirarchy
** implicit conversions of Int to RichInt
* traits
** extends
** with
** cannot have class Parameters
** super calls are statically bound whereas in classes they are dynamically bound (_stackable modifications_)
** makes easier to write rich interfaces
** e.g. Ordered
** Stackable modifications using linearization
* packages
** can be nested like Java or C# namespaces
* imports
** can appear anywhere
** may refer to objects or singletons
** can also rename
*** e.g. import Fruits.{Apple => McIntosh, Orange}, here Apple has been renamed to McIntosh
*** e.g. import Fruits.{Pear => _, _} //imports all from Fruits except Pear
* Access Modifiers
** private : only accessible from within the class in which it has been defined
*** unlike java outer class cannot access the members of inner class
** protected : only from the sub classes, not even from the same package as in java
** private [X] acess is visible upto x
** object private : private[this]
*** val obj = new Nav
*** obj.blah //this will not compile, _even if the code is in class Nav_
** Companion objects
*** a class shares all its  access rights with its companion object and vice-versa
* Testing
** ScalaTest
*** FunSuite : test as a function passed as a call-by-name parameter
*** Spec : Behavior-driven-development
**** Describers
**** Specifiers
** Junit
** TestNg
** ScalaCheck
*** properties
*** generators
* case classes and pattern matching
** case class Var(x:String) extends Expr
*** makes it pattern matchable
*** adds a factory method for construction z.b. val x = Var ("a")
*** all elements in the parameter list get a val prefix, so they are maintained as fields
*** natural implementaions of equals, toString, hashcode are added, they will be computed for the whole tree of the class and its parameters
** match is an expression in scala
** constants can also be used in the pattern matching
** back-tick can be used to refer to constants e.g. `pi`
** case List(0, _*) matches a list starting with 0 and then having 0 or more elements
** typed patterns
*** pattern matching cannot be done on the types of arguments of collections due to erasure
**** e.g. case m:Map[_,_] => m.size //this is OK
**** but case m:Map[Int, Int] =>  //this will always execute for any type of map
**** Arrays work since they are handled differently
** variable patterns
*** e.g. case Unop("abs", e @ Unop("abs",_)) => e
** pattern guards
*** e.g. case n:Int if (n > 0)=> n
*** case BinOp("+", x, y) if (x == y) => BinOp("*", x, Num(2))
** sealed classes
*** subclasses can only be present in the same class where parent exists
*** compiler warns for missing cases in pattern matching
** patterns to deconstruct
*** val BinOp(op, left, right) = exp
*** val (first, snd) = tuple
** case sequences as partial functions
** patterns in for-expression
* lists
** cons and concatenate associate to right
** Type inference in flow based
*** When designing a polymorphic method that takes some non-function arguments and a function argument, place the function argument last in a curried parameter list by its own.
*** def mergeSort[T](less: (T, T) => Boolean)(list: List[T]): List[T]
**** mergeSort[Int](_ < _)(list)
*** def mergeSort[T](list:List[T])(less:(T,T)=>Boolean)
**** mergeSortSwapped(list)(_ < _)
* Other collections
** Iterable
*** Seq -- ordered collections
**** List
**** Array
**** ListBuffer
***** constant prepend (+:) and append (+=) operations
**** Queue - mutable and immutable
**** Stack - mutable and immutable
**** String - Seq[Char]
*** Set (== based atmost one element in the collection)
**** Immutable ==> Hashset, TreeSet
**** Mutable ==> Hashset, TreeSet
*** Map
**** Immutable ==> HashMap, TreeMap
**** Mutable ==> HashMap, TreeMap
*** thread safe
**** e.g. val threadSafeSet = new mutable.HashSet[String]() with mutable.SynchronizedSet
*** += and other operations ending with "=" work on var for collections and all other types
**** e.g. var set2 = Set(1,2); set2 += 3
* Stateful objects
** var hours = 12 defined in a class
** has getter hours and setter hours_
** var x:Int = _
*** initializes a default value
** var x:Int
*** this is an abstract variable
* Type parameterization
** Variance : defines the inheritance relationship of parameterized types
*** Covariance: if S <: T, Then Queue[S] <: Queue[T] holds
*** Nonvariance: if S <: T, Then Queue[S] <: Queue[T] does not hold, neither other way around
*** Contravariant: if S <: T, Then Queue[S] >: Queue[T] holds
*** as soon as a generic parameter type appears as the type of a method parameter, the containing class or trait may not be covariant in that type parameter
**** e.g. append method in List
** Type constructor: Queue[Int]
** Liskov Substitution Principle
*** it is safe to assume that a type T is a subtype of a type U if you can sub- stitute a value of type T wherever a value of type U is required.
** Function
*** arguments: contravariant
*** return value: covariant
* Abstract Members
** val
** var
** type
** method
** it is fine to override a def with a val, but not the other way around
** lazy vals
** path dependent types
* Implicit conversions and parameters
** Implicit definitions are those that the compiler is allowed to insert into a program in order to fix any of its type errors
** Rules
*** Only definitions marked implicit are available
*** An inserted implicit conversion must be in scope as a single identifier, or be associated with the source or target type of the conversion
**** exception: The compiler will also look for implicit definitions in the companion object of the source or expected target types of the conversion
*** An implicit conversion is only inserted if there is no other possible conversion to insert
*** Only one implicit is tried
*** Whenever code type checks as it is written, no implicits are attempted
** Where implicits are tried
*** conversion to an expected type
*** conversion of the receiver of the selection
**** receiver is the object on which method is invoked
*** implicit parameters
* For expressions
** for (seq) yield expr
*** seq is a sequence of generators, definitions and filters
*** *generator*
**** pat <- expr
*** *definition*
**** pat = expr
*** *filter*
**** if expr
*** e.g for (p <- persons; n=p.name; if(n startsWith "To")) yield p
* Extractors
** an extractor extracts the parameters from which an object passed to it was created
** lets you define new patterns for existing types
** whenever pattern matching encounters a pattern referring to an extractor object, it invokes the extractor’s unapply method on the selector expression
** can be used on generic types also, scala typecheck will take care of correct application
** extraction and injection
*** extraction == T == Some(n1,n2...) [unapply/unapplySeq]
*** injection == (n1,n2...) => T [apply]
*** should be dual of each other
*** Email.unapply(Email.apply(user, domain)) == Some(user, domain)
** pattern *case Email(user,domain)* will invoke Email.unapply(user:User):Option[(String,String)]
** *def unapply(object: S): Option[(T1, ..., Tn)]*
** variable binding
** extractors important points
*** representation independence
*** every regex in scala defines an extractor
* Annotations
** meta-programming tools
*** annotations act as directives to these tools
** annotations general form
*** @annot(exp1, exp2, ...) {val name1=const1, ..., val namen=constn}
**** @deprecated
**** @volatile
**** @SerialVersionUID(1234)
**** @transient
**** @scala.beans.BeanProperty
***** generates get and set methods for a field
* XML
** semi-structured data
* Equality
** avoid pitfalls
*** _Defining equals with the wrong signature_ : always use *override def equals(other: Any): Boolean*
*** _Changing equals without also changing hashCode_
*** _Defining equals in terms of mutable fields_
*** _Failing to define equals as an equivalence relation_
**** reflexive
**** transitive
**** symmetric
**** consistent
**** non-null with null is always false
** use canEquals _canEquals this_
** cache hashCode for performance reasons using _override def val hashCode = ???_
* Scala and Java
** use javap to inspect
** singleton object is translated to _App$_ format
** annotations
** *Existential Types*
*** general form is *type forSome { declarations }*
**** ex 1 Iterator<?> == Iterator[T] forSome { type T } == Iterator[_]
**** ex 2 Iterator<? extends Component> == Iterator [T] forSome { T <: Component } == Iterator[_ <: Component]
* type classes
** A type class _C_ defines some behaviour in the form of operations that must be supported by a type T for it to be a member of type class C
* path dependent types
** a nested type is bound to a specific instance of the outer type, not to the outer type itself
